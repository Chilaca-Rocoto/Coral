    "body": "Please note the changes to training.\r\n\r\nFirst, all rewards are now percentages . Damage taken is now a percentage of a player's base health. Anything that has to do with attacking is relative to the number of attacks performed since the last episode. This means that, by default, they all have the same relative weight. This does not mean that they're inherently compatible, it just means that it's easier to work with them by default. If a player loses 5% of their health in one attack, that same percentage is up against a 50% block rate. Account for these in your policies. It's much easier than all of the values being arbitrary.\r\n\r\nSecond, @chanel-koh has spoken. All rewards are positive. Whether a statistic is a reward or a punishment is up to the person designing the reward policy. If you want to write a reward policy that rewards the player for losing health or for being far, it's up to you!\r\n\r\nThe canonical way of naming a hyperparameter in the reward policy is `perParamName`. Here are the new reward policy names:\r\n\r\n`perDamageTaken`: The percentage of health the player has lost since the last episode\r\n`perDamageDealt`: The percentage of health the enemy has lost since the last episode\r\n`perDamageDealtByDiversity`: The percentage of health the enemy has lost since the last episode scaled by how diverse the moves that have been used were\r\n`perAttackLanded`: The percentage of attacks landed since the last episode\r\n`perAttackWhiffed`: The percentage of attacks whiffed since the last episode\r\n`perAttackPerformedButBlocked`: The percentage of attacks performed but blocked since the last episode\r\n`perPlayerHealthByTime`: The percentage of health the player has scaled by the current remaining match time (if you want a model that wants to take damage)\r\n`perOpponentHealthByTime`: The percentage of health the enemy has scaled by the current remaining match time\r\n`perDistanceTooClose`: The percentage of how close the player is (it's currently 0-0.4 and may change)\r\n`perDistanceClose`: The percentage of how close the player is based on a small constant (it's currently 0.4-0.9 and may change)\r\n`perDistanceFar`: The percentage of how far the player is from their opponent based on the length of the stage",

    "body": "Hello! Here are the patch notes for this version. Celebrate!\r\n- Organized scripts into _Capstone folder\r\n- Put more advanced models in _Capstone/Training/Models\r\n- Put checkpoint models in _Capstone/Training/Models/Checkpoints\r\n- Located and solved the lag bug, to an extent (read below for more info)\r\n- Moved DQN and ReplayBuffer classes that were all kept in the same Python file to their own Python files\r\n- Implemented training for multiple agents at once (read below for more info)\r\n- Consolidated DQNTraining and Resume_training into one file\r\n- Wrote GUI that allows the user to specify values for an agent's training session\r\n- Added summon support to the agent\r\n- Implemented move staling (read below for more info)\r\n- Tweaked some reward values (read below for more info)\r\n\r\n### The Lag\r\nLeanTween was most likely causing the lag. I think that the game was running for a lot longer without reloading the scene than it would ever when people were playing (matches are usually three to five rounds, and the game only allows players to play three rounds so far). To fix the issue, I made it so that the FightManager reloads the scene and clears all LeanTween processes every 30 rounds. The lag is gone now, and I'm pretty sure we can train models overnight. I've trained models for hours at a time after this change.\r\n\r\n### Parallel Training\r\nMultiple agents can train at the same time. Each agent gets their own independent GymSocketClient. When training, run `/train 0 1` to train both agents at the same time. If you only want one agent in the scene, it's a matter of just running `/train 0` or `/train 1`. The integer specifies the port. Note that the default value for running `/train` with no parameters is `0`, meaning that port 0 will be an agent. The system is still a bit finicky, so some manual work has to be done if you want to play against a model or run the current in game CPU against a model.\r\nRegardless, this is great news. Fresh models can run against existing ones. Fresh models can be run against each other. You can have a training model and a playing model running against each other. With some more work, the GUI can be used in any model, as long as they take the same parameters. If you want to work on your own GUI (something that differs greatly from the DQN's GUI), then just ask me and I'll help you out. The GUI is written using PySide6.\r\nIf you want to run multiple models, run `CoralGui.py`. Rider allows you to run multiple instances of a Python script if you enable it here:\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2f20fa6-35b6-4098-8ad5-d6b9b4e0bce0\" />\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5bef1c0-dd18-4d23-8009-b8570da0298d\" />\r\nThe training menu looks like this:\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b1eb382-2b3e-432f-8c79-46ec9094d4ae\" />\r\n\r\n### Move Staling\r\nThis is in the game domain, but it'll help with something that we've seen in training before. The model seemed to find the best move and stick to it the entire time. I've taken the Super Smash Bros. Brawl move staling system and applied it to the base game. In short, each fighter has a nine move buffer that is used to calculate a damage and speed reduction for moves. This means that if the model decides to repeatedly attack, as long as those attacks land, they'll be weaker and weaker until the model decides to diversify it's attacking moves. Hooray!\r\n\r\n### Reward Values\r\nI've tweaked some reward values. @chanel-koh may work on the hyperparameter tuner, which is great, but for now I've tried to point the model in a better direction than it was going. First of all, the models loved to hug the walls, which is a pretty good strategy to avoid damage, so the punishment for being too far increases with distance. In addition, while the actual game doesn't care if the players spam moves that don't land, the models are punished linearly according to how many moves they've missed since the last episode (unless they haven't attacked at all).\r\n\r\n### Alex's Notes\r\n- The hirelings can hit their summoner sometimes. I'll fix this because it's a game mechanic, but it means that the agents will quickly learn that summoning hirelings will get them damaged, oops.\r\n- The model can input moves so fast that the game never gets a chance to flip them sometimes. I've only seen this a handful of times, but it's like my dad says: the model will learn according to the broken game mechanics.\r\n- Notes on the performances of the agents will be gold now. It'll be really easy to gauge whether a set of hyperparameters are doing what they should\r\n- On the note of hyperparameters, getting a system that makes it really easy to have different hyperparameter definitions will be great since now that's going to be a huge focus.\r\n- We should get all branches rebased onto main, now and especially after this pull request goes though. If you want to do work as soon as possible (it's break, so take it easy), you can rebase onto this branch. There have been a lot of changes, so rebasing is essential right now.\r\n- We should give the model both the agent's and their opponent's move buffers\r\n- We should give the agents the current match time as a percentage\r\n- We should pass the agents the current hireling that they're selecting and also give them the ability to cycle a hireling as an action\r\n- We should give the agent the ability to trigger the teleport move and pass the opponent's current teleport position. This is more involved as it requires keeping track of both the agent's and their opponent's current teleport position (infinity when they're not present). If you didn't know that there was a teleportation move in the game, that's completely understandable! Not even my vector based model used it a lot.\r\n- We can make the agent's driver's license display their model name when they're loaded in. This might seem like a touch to make people go 'Nice', but it also will actually help with training. Imagine training overnight, or watching some else's training session.\r\n- We should leave a model running for an entire weekend. 1,000,000 episodes. Maybe even make it a fresh one. I'm curious what will happen, and the lab computer is always running.\r\n- We should determine how many checkpoints we're going to keep. Right now, there are 55 checkpoint files, just from training a couple of sessions. They're small, but they come in large quantities. If we train 1,000,000 episodes and save every 1,000, that's 1000 checkpoint files to keep track of. Note that if we can get a graph with statistics at certain episodes, we can easily point to ones that perform well, fairly, and/or that aren't overfit.\r\n- We should benchmark training at different speeds. With five instances (x1, x5, x10, x20, x25), we can get a good idea of how the speed affects the gameplay.\r\n- We need to implement a way of having the game use inference on existing models without requiring the Python script.\r\n- We should find a way of making the GUI I've written general so that it can be used for many models.\r\n- From what I remember, we can get multiple instances of the game running with multiple instances of Python with a couple of changes (which is just allowing the user to input the base port). How many can we run in parallel?\r\n- More models! Now that we can train with ease, we need to write a lot of models.\r\n- This is the second version of the software. During our next meeting, we have to determine what the first version's (the demo) pepper was and what this version's pepper is. I predict we'll have one or two more major ones, so we can keep that in mind when dividing up the Scoville chart.\r\n\r\n### Alex's Notes On The Menu\r\nWe have to ask ourselves what should go where, UI-wise. For example, it's clear that training metrics should go inside of the program and not a separate GUI. On the other hand, there are test menus that are supposed to load models. These are possible, but we're going to have to get Python functionality from Unity. Here's what I'm thinking:\r\n- The Status tab keeps track of the connection status between Unity and the Python script. Some modifications have to be done to make it support multi-agent training.\r\n- We keep Training Activity. Real Time and Simulated Time are great to know, along with the number of episodes that have passed. We should remove the Epochs and Iterations and make the graph display the cumulative reward for the models over time.\r\n- Time Scale is, by far, the most useful thing in the Configurations tab. In fact, when we have parallel training going, all three of those menu items will be essential for good user experience. I say that we get those in another menu, maybe even in the Status menu (to make it instantly appear).\r\n- The Stats menu will be great. Knowing these statistics live will be excellent benchmarks, but I think that the 'Save As' input should be removed. The Stats menu can also cache values over time (i.e. at each episode) and allow the user to view the graphs over time. This will allow people training the model to go back and pick out models that look good.\r\n- Save/Load Models is a tab that I'm looking at with a raised eyebrow. Yes, it's convenient, but think of the premise. To train the models, we need Python. To try and get Unity running Python scripts isn't nearly as helpful as just working on the Coral GUI for training bootstrapping. I say that the tab should be removed.\r\n- The Hyperparameters tab is one that I'm excited about. This is great and I have no notes.\r\n- The Log is also helpful. It's useful to debug.\r\n- I'm not worried about the New tab all that much. Honestly, I don't know if there will be another character by the end of the semester, and starting a new training session should be as simple as creating a new instance of the MlConfigMenu, restarting the application, or stopping and replaying from inside of Unity. We shouldn't focus on this menu, and instead just get a simple Reload or Close button for the menu. Help isn't essential at all, and if we need descriptions of the different menus they should be in those menus, probably as tooltips.\r\n- When it comes to hiding the menu, we should definitely make it so that clicking the - button after the menu has already closed collapses it again. This will add a lot more visibility.\r\n\r\nShoutout to my dad for helping out!",
